# Wine-Classification-Data-Science-Project
Applying different ML Classification algorithms on the [wine data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) and getting inferences from the data using Python.

## System Requirements
1. Python3 must be installed on the PC
2. Important statistical libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and scikit-learn.
3. The code can be run in Jupyter-notebook and Google collaboratory both.

## Data Set Information
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. The data is Multivariate.

The attributes are:
1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid 
3. Ash
4. Alkalinity of ash 
5. Magnesium
6. Total phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid phenols 
9. Proanthocyanins 
10. Color intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
13. Proline

## Attribute and Class Information
There are 13 attributes in total. All attributes are continuous data. Dataset was verified to contain no missing attribute values.

There are a total of 3 classes and a total of 178 instances:
* Class 1 - 59 instances
* Class 2 - 71 instances
* Class 3 - 48 instances

## Data Preprocessing
We have calculated the measures of central tendencies and it can be summarized in the contingency table below:
